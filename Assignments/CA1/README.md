# Background
You will participate in an InClass Kaggle competition (only students enrolled in DAT300 course are allowed to participate), where you will build classification models.

# About the data
You are provided the data from the Titanic disaster. You are supposed to train models that predict whether a person survived the event or not. 

NOTE: We have modified the original data to make the modelling part a bit more challenging. Solutions or models you find on the internet will not be optimal for the data you will work with,

 

# Modelling
Both points in the numbered list below (three models) are needed to pass the compulsory. The first point (two models) is only for the hand-in, while the second point (one model) is to be used in the Kaggle competition. All three models should be available in a single Jupyter Notebook. Processing on Kaggle or Google Colab is recommended.

Use scikit-learn to predict the survival of passengers in the data found on Kaggle. Apply necessary data splitting, cross-validations, grid searches, or whatever you need to tune your models. These two models form the minimum requirement for part 1:
Classification model based on algorithms from scikit-learn (e.g. logistic regression, possibly regularized, Support Vector Classifier, etc.).
Ensemble model (e.g. random forest or similar)
Use Keras to create an ANN predicting the same concrete strength. Find a good balance of layers, nodes, regularization to perform well. Only the ANN results shall be used for the Kaggle competition.
 

# Requirements for submissions
To have the compulsory assignment approved you need fulfill the following:

Your group must appear on the leaderboard of our own Kaggle competition, which means that you must submit at least one prediction (link to the leaderboard): https://www.kaggle.com/c/dat300-h2021-ca1/leaderboard (Links to an external site.)
You are expected to beat the lowest benchmark accuracy score of 0.80 (named "Beat Me" on the leaderboard).
Use the Jupyter Notebook template we provided you in our repository (insert here) and follow the instructions
Submit the following: (I) Your Jupyter notebook here on Canvas; (II) A PDF of your Jupyter notebook here on Canvas. Both should contain the code for the training of your best classification models in each of the three categories: (a) model based on one classification algorithm; (b) ensemble model; (c) model based on ANN). Provide also the computation of the prediction for each of the categories. Please follow the instruction in the Jupyter notebook template on where to comment on your work, what to comment and how much to comment.
Provide your Kaggle group name AND your real names at the beginning of your Jupyter notebook.
